# Next.js Rendering Error: Unhelpful Error Messages on Syntax Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked issue in Next.js development: unhelpful error messages when simple syntax errors exist in your page components.  Specifically, this focuses on situations where a missing closing bracket or tag causes the application to render incorrectly without providing clear guidance on the location of the error. 

## Problem

Next.js's error handling might not always pinpoint the exact location of a simple syntax error, like a missing closing bracket in a JSX expression within `pages/index.js`.  This can lead to significant debugging time.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing your JSX syntax in the page components. Tools like linters (e.g., ESLint) and code formatters (e.g., Prettier) can prevent these errors in the first place. Thorough testing and careful attention to detail during development are also crucial.
